# RFSoC MINI 2SB Receiver
This repository contains Simulink models for **(Ideal) Digital Sideband Separation** on RFSoC 4x2 for Southern Millimeter Wave Telescope (or Southern Mini). Python and C++ scripts for initialization, control, and data analysis are included.

## üß† Simulink Models
The `64_bits_models/` and `32_bits_models/` folder contains Simulink designs for FPGA programming. Each model is built using Xilinx System Generator for DSP and targets FPGA boards such as the Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC. To design the spectrometers, [CASPER toolflow](https://casper-toolflow.readthedocs.io/projects/tutorials/en/latest/tutorials/rfsoc/tut_getting_started.html) must be installed.

### 64 bits models (Experimental Only)
Three 64-bits models were designed and used in laboratory for test ideal sideband separation. These models have a 1.96608 GHz bandwidth and 64-bit BRAMs, and are available for the next spectral resolutions:
- 2048 channels
- 8192 channels
- 16384 channels

### 32 bits models
Due to the 32-bit limitation of the radiotelescope microcontroller (PIC32), this repository includes spectrometer models with 32-bit BRAMs. These models are available for different spectral resolutions:
- 8192 channels
- 16384 channels
- 32768 channels
- 65536 channels (implemented in two separate models due to resource limitations.)

Each model includes:
- 32-bit BRAM blocks for data acquisition, named `synth0_i` and `synth1_i` for the high-resolution spectrometer, and `re_bin_synth0_i` and `re_bin_synth1_i` for the 512-channel spectrometer in parallel.
- Reset accumulation control.
- Bits re-quantization blocks.

> üîß **Note:** For the 32768 and 65536 channel models, the User IP Clock Rate in the RFSoC 4x2 Simulink block was reduced to 122.88 MHz to adjust timing and resource constraints.

## üíª Python Scripts

This repository includes Python scripts for initializing the RFSoC, configuring registers, capturing data, and performing post-processing (e.g., plotting spectra, SRR, etc.).

## üì° Mini Implementation

This section includes Python and C++ scripts used for communication testing and deployment of the RFSoC-based spectrometer system at the Southern Millimeter Wave Telescope (Mini). Some scripts run on the RFSoC board, while others run on the control computer or data server.

### üêç Python Scripts

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rfsoc4x2_spec_ini.py` | Initializes and programs the RFSoC with the selected spectrometer model. <br>**Usage:** `python rfsoc4x2_spec_ini.py` |
| `cpp_interface.py` | Python interface that repeatedly requests spectra via the C++ client and measures the response time. Results are logged to a `.csv` file. <br>**Usage:** `python cpp_interface.py` |
| `plot.py` | Plots delays recorded during spectrum acquisition requests. <br>**Usage:** `python plot.py` |
| `rfsoc_mini_client.py` | Python client script used in the Mini radiotelescope Data Server. Requests spectra and transmits them to the PIC32 microcontroller. Does not log timings. <br>**Usage:** `python rfsoc_mini_client.py` |

### üíª C++ Scripts

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rfsoc_server.cpp` | C++ server that runs on the RFSoC. Waits for incoming client connections and serves spectrum data. |
| `cpp_socket.cpp` | C++ client that connects to the RFSoC server and requests spectra. It is compiled as a Python extension using pybind11, allowing integration with Python scripts. |

### üîÑ Execution Flow

Below is the standard sequence to run the RFSoC spectrometer system from both ends:

1. **Program the RFSoC with the Spectrometer Bitstream**  
   This step loads the selected spectrometer model onto the RFSoC using the initialization script:

   ```bash
   python rfsoc4x2_spec_ini.py

2. **Start the RFSoC Server**  
   Connect via SSH to the RFSoC and execute:

   ```bash
   g++ rfsoc_server.cpp -o rfsoc_server
   sudo ./rfsoc_server

3. **Compile the C++ Socket Client**  
   On the control computer, compile:

   ```bash
   c++ -O3 -Wall -shared -std=c++11 -fPIC `python3 -m pybind11 --includes` cpp_socket.cpp -o cpp_socket`python3-config --extension-suffix`

4. **Run the Python Interface**  
   Choose one of the following scripts depending on the use case:

   - **Laboratory testing interface** ‚Äì This script repeatedly requests spectra via the C++ client and measures the response time. It logs the delays in a `.csv` file for later analysis.

     ```bash
     python cpp_interface.py
     ```

   - **Mini telescope deployment interface** ‚Äì This script runs on the Data Server located at the Mini telescope site. It requests spectra from the RFSoC and sends them directly to the PIC32 microcontroller, without logging timing information.

     ```bash
     python rfsoc_mini_client.py
     ```
